# Find Shows

A my small demo from the [Seattle Ticket Master dev jam](https://www.universe.com/events/the-ticketmaster-api-devjam-in-seattle-wa-tickets-seattle-T3GYKJ)! So as you can imagine the code quality is pretty poor.

Uses Mithril JS, PureCSS, some Google fonts, a couple pics I lifted from GIS, and of course the Ticket Master API.

Put your API key in index.js, then spin up an http server (I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) and go!
